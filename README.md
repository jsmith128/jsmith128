### “As human beings, unless we have someone to compliment our work and enjoy what we’ve created, we’re not apt to go out on a limb"

###### “Programmers should never say no. When you’re making games, if a programmer says, “That’s impossible,” it not only puts the brakes on a valuable idea but makes it harder for the next idea to come. If programmers only focus on things that are easy to program, they’ll never break the mold and come up with fascinating ideas.<br/>“What would it take to make it possible?” And from there he establishes the necessary conditions. This is about cornering the opponent and jabbing at the weak points they can’t block.”

###### “What's reality? I don't know. When my bird was looking at my computer monitor I thought, "Woah, that bird has no idea what he's looking at." And yet what does the bird do? Does he panic? No, he can't really panic, he just does the best he can. Is he able to live in a world where he's so ignorant? Well, he doesn't really have a choice. Yeah, he can kind of live. Usually the bird's okay, even though he doesn't understand the world. He can kind of learn what's safe and what's dangerous... You're that bird looking at the monitor, and you're thinking to yourself, "I can figure this out." Maybe you have some bird ideas that are- ...maybe that's the best you can do.”

###### “It was a weird day when I realized that, when I was young, there was a huge chasm separating mortals from immortals. And people like Led Zeppelin that made songs; they were immortal. And then one day I realized, "oh my god, I can make a song," I was like "wow that is the weirdest thing." The immortals are the ones who make the music, and the mortals are the ones who listen.”

###### “There's a string shooting out from the back of my mind. It's behind me... living. I can't see it. I've just heard about it. <br/>No one knows of how long it is, or how far it goes, including me!”
